To generate comprehensive test cases, follow this structured approach:

1. Analyze core functionality requirements
   - Identify key features and expected behaviors
   - Define input/output specifications
   - Document any constraints or dependencies

2. Design test scenarios
   - Cover positive test cases (expected usage)
   - Include negative test cases (error conditions)
   - Test edge cases and boundary values
   - Consider performance requirements

3. Structure test implementation
   - Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
   - Use descriptive test names that indicate scenario
   - Group related tests into logical categories
   - Ensure test independence and isolation

4. Quality checks
   - Verify test coverage metrics
   - Validate error handling
   - Confirm readability and maintainability
   - Document any test assumptions or prerequisites

5. Maintain and update
   - Review tests during code changes
   - Update tests for new requirements
   - Remove obsolete test cases
   - Monitor test execution performance
