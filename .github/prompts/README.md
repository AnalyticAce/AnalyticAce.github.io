# Prompts Organization

This directory contains various AI prompts organized by category to support different aspects of software development.

## Directory Structure

### üìÅ development-roles/
Contains role-specific prompts that define expertise and responsibilities for different software development roles:

- **`software-engineer.prompt.md`** - General software engineering expertise
- **`frontend-development.prompt.md`** - Frontend development specialization (React, Vue, Angular, CSS, accessibility)
- **`backend-development.prompt.md`** - Backend development specialization (APIs, databases, server-side logic)
- **`software-architect.prompt.md`** - System architecture and design patterns
- **`performance-engineer.prompt.md`** - Performance optimization and analysis
- **`security-expert.prompt.md`** - Security assessment and implementation
- **`code-reviewer.prompt.md`** - Code review and quality assurance

### üìÅ workflow-patterns/
Contains prompts that define different development methodologies and workflow approaches:

- **`sequential-processing.prompt.md`** - Multi-agent sequential development workflow
- **`parallel-processing.prompt.md`** - Parallel development with distributed tasks
- **`iterative-refinement.prompt.md`** - Iterative development with continuous improvement

### üìÅ task-specific/
Contains detailed instructions for specific development tasks with comprehensive implementation guidance:

- **`project-initialization.prompt.md`** - Complete project setup with tooling, structure, and configuration
- **`api-development.prompt.md`** - REST API development with security, validation, and documentation
- **`frontend-component-development.prompt.md`** - React/Vue component development with accessibility
- **`database-operations.prompt.md`** - Database design, ORM implementation, and optimization
- **`test-suite-creation.prompt.md`** - Comprehensive testing strategy (unit, integration, E2E)
- **`performance-optimization.prompt.md`** - Performance analysis and optimization techniques
- **`cicd-pipeline-creation.prompt.md`** - Complete CI/CD pipeline with security and monitoring

## Usage Guidelines

### Role-Based Prompts
Use development-roles prompts when you need:
- Specialized expertise in a specific domain
- Role-specific guidance and best practices
- Technical consultation for particular aspects of development

### Workflow Prompts
Use workflow-patterns prompts when you need:
- Structured development processes
- Multi-phase project execution
- Coordinated team development approaches

### Task-Specific Prompts
Use task-specific prompts when you need:
- Step-by-step implementation guidance for specific development tasks
- Comprehensive checklists with best practices and security considerations
- Detailed examples and code templates for common development scenarios
- End-to-end delivery guidance from planning to deployment

## Best Practices

1. **Choose the Right Prompt**: Select prompts based on your specific needs and project requirements
2. **Combine When Appropriate**: Role-based prompts can be combined with workflow patterns for comprehensive development approaches
3. **Customize as Needed**: These prompts serve as templates - adapt them to your specific project context
4. **Keep Updated**: Regularly review and update prompts to reflect current best practices and technologies

## Contributing

When adding new prompts:

1. Determine the appropriate category (role vs. workflow vs. task-specific)
2. Follow the existing naming convention: `[name].prompt.md`
3. Include clear descriptions of the prompt's purpose and use cases
4. Update this README to reflect any new additions or changes
