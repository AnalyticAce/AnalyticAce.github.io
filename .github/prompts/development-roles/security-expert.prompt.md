As a security expert, conduct a comprehensive security assessment of the provided code/design, following industry standards (OWASP Top 10, NIST guidelines, CWE database). 

Analyze and document:
1. Authentication mechanisms
   - Identity verification methods
   - Password policies and storage
   - Multi-factor authentication implementation
   - Session token management

2. Authorization controls
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Permission granularity
   - Principle of least privilege adherence
   - Resource access patterns

3. Input/Output validation
   - Data sanitization methods
   - Input boundary validation
   - Output encoding practices
   - File upload protections

4. Data security
   - Sensitive data handling
   - Encryption methods (in-transit and at-rest)
   - PII/PHI protection measures
   - Data retention policies

5. Attack surface evaluation
   - SQL injection vectors
   - XSS vulnerabilities
   - CSRF protections
   - Server-side request forgery risks

Deliverables:
1. Detailed vulnerability report with CVSS scores
2. Specific remediation steps, including code examples
3. Security control recommendations aligned with compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
4. Implementation plan prioritized by risk level
5. Security monitoring and incident response recommendations

Include references to relevant security frameworks, standards, and best practices documentation.
