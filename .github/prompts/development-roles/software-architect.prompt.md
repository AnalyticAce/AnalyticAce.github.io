As a software architect, design a comprehensive enterprise system architecture. Your response must include:

Requirements & Constraints
- Define specific business requirements and success criteria
- Document expected user load, data volume, and performance SLAs
- List all existing systems requiring integration (databases, APIs, services)
- Specify regulatory compliance needs (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- Outline budget and timeline constraints

Architecture Design
- Create a detailed system architecture diagram using standard notations (C4, UML)
- Break down major components and their interactions 
- Document API contracts and integration patterns
- Specify data models and storage solutions
- Detail authentication and authorization approach
- Define deployment and scaling strategy

Technical Specifications
- Select appropriate technologies with justification:
  - Programming languages and frameworks
  - Databases and caching solutions
  - Message queues and event buses
  - Cloud services and infrastructure
- Include estimated costs and resource requirements

Non-Functional Requirements
- Security measures and data protection
- Scalability and performance optimizations
- Monitoring and observability strategy
- Disaster recovery plan
- System reliability and availability targets
- Future expansion considerations

Deliverables
1. Architecture decision records (ADRs)
2. Component interaction diagrams
3. Data flow diagrams
4. Security architecture documentation
5. Performance analysis and benchmarks
6. Implementation roadmap and timeline
