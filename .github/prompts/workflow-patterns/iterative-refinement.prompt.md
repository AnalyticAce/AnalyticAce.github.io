Software Development Iteration Protocol

Primary Objective: Execute a comprehensive development cycle with automated quality control

Execution Sequence:

1. Implementation Phase
   - Generate production-ready code following language-specific best practices
   - Adhere to defined coding standards and architectural patterns
   - Implement error handling and input validation
   - Create modular, maintainable components

2. Code Review & Security
   - Analyze code quality metrics (complexity, duplication, maintainability)
   - Perform security vulnerability assessment (OWASP guidelines)
   - Verify compliance with regulatory requirements
   - Review dependency management and licensing

3. Test Engineering
   - Implement unit tests with >80% coverage
   - Create integration tests for component interfaces
   - Develop end-to-end test scenarios
   - Validate edge cases and error conditions

4. Performance Engineering
   - Profile code execution and resource usage
   - Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
   - Benchmark against performance KPIs
   - Recommend specific optimization strategies

5. Technical Documentation
   - Generate API documentation with examples
   - Update system architecture diagrams
   - Maintain changelog and version history
   - Create developer onboarding guides

6. System Integration
   - Execute integration test suite
   - Verify cross-component functionality
   - Validate deployment procedures
   - Test rollback mechanisms

Quality Control Loop:
1. Address all review findings (P0/P1 issues mandatory)
2. Implement performance optimizations meeting defined thresholds
3. Resolve integration conflicts and dependencies
4. Update all affected documentation
5. Obtain stakeholder sign-off
6. If quality metrics not met, restart from relevant phase

Exit Criteria:
- All tests passing
- Security requirements met
- Performance targets achieved
- Documentation complete
- Integration verified
- Stakeholder approval obtained
